**4. Lowercase and Uppercase Alphabet**
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.

**5. Printing the Alphabet without 'q' and 'e'**
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using only the putchar function.

**6. Single Digit Numbers**
This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.

**7. Single Digit Numbers without char variable**
This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function and without using a variable of type char.

**8. Reverse Alphabet**
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.

**9. Hexadecimal Numbers**
This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.

**100. Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers**
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by a comma and a space, in ascending order, using only the putchar function and without using a variable of type char.

**101. Combinations of Two Digits**
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits separated by a comma and a space, in ascending order and with two digits, using only the putchar function and without using a variable of type char.

**102. Combinations of Three Digits**
